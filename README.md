# Web Developer Test Task

In order to test your development capability but also your approach, we would like you to create a simple quiz of 5 questions, each of which have three possible answers. Each answer has a score of:

* Answer A = 5 points
* Answer B = 10 points
* Answer C = 15 points

Once the user has selected their answer they will click a next button to view the next question. Please add a class of active to the active question and remove from any inactive questions. The result of each question should be stored in local storage so it can be easily retrieved at the end of the quiz

Once the user reaches question 5 the button will be a submit button. When the user submits the quiz they will be redirected to a results page which will show them:

Their total score as a percentage
Their rating:
0 - 33% = below average
34% - 66% = average
67% - 10% = above average
A simple bar chart showing their score per answer
Output their score and rating to a PDF

As the aim of the test is to check your understanding and approach to the project, you do not need to style the quiz, it just needs to work however feel free to add any basic styling you see fit.
